## Research Track

A PDF version of Research Track call for papers is available to download from here.

The Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2021 will take place virtually and/or in-person from June 29th to July 2nd, 2021, hosted by Saarland University. This 32nd event continues the series of highly successful Eurographics Symposia and Workshops on Rendering.

All accepted research papers will be presented at EGSR 2021 and archived in the Eurographics digital library. Furthermore, a selection of them will be published in an issue of the Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) journal, based on both the recommendations of the reviewers and the outcome of a second cycle of review.

We are looking for work that shapes the future of rendering in computer graphics and related fields, such as virtual and augmented reality, deep learning, and computational photography.

There is no fixed minimum or maximum paper length. However, submissions over 12 pages in length will be treated as exceptional cases, and length must be proportional to contribution.

For each submitted paper, a minimum of 3 reviews will be provided to the authors, who will then be able to provide a rebuttal to clarify misunderstandings and answer the reviewers’ questions. The reviewers will then discuss and decide on the acceptance of the paper to the EGSR 2021 program. In the event of acceptance, the authors will submit a revised version of their manuscript prior to the conference. All papers will be presented virtually. An in-person event might happen, but attendance by authors won’t be mandatory.

### Topics of interest

We invite original contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in topics related, but not limited, to:

- Physically-based rendering (PBR) and global illumination
- Monte Carlo sampling and integration
- Real-time rendering, including ray tracing, acceleration structures, and GPU algorithms
- Rendering software systems
- Specialized rendering hardware

- Inverse and differentiable rendering
- Machine learning for rendering, rendering for machine learning
- Neural rendering, generative models of images

- Image processing for rendering and compositing, such as denoising, matting, deblurring, colorization
- Image manipulation, such as warping, inpainting, relighting
- Computational photography, optics & displays
- Image-based rendering (IBR), lightfields
- Expressive/Non-Photorealistic rendering (NPR), vector graphics

- Material and scattering models
- Acquisition and modeling of geometry and appearance
- Procedural modelling, texture synthesis, geometry, and simulation
- Face and human rendering

- Augmented/virtual reality, including rendering, input, and output technologies
- Human perception of rendered images
- Scientific visualization, e.g. large-scale data visualization and volume rendering
- Audio/sound rendering

## Industry Track

A PDF version of Industry Track call for paper is available to download from here.
The Eurographics Symposium on Rendering (EGSR) 2021 includes an Industry Track that includes invited papers from our colleagues in industry that are on topics of interest to the general rendering community. The goal of this track is to provide an accessible venue for getting out ideas that have found practical use in industry and could impact the future of rendering research, but that do not meet the standards of scientific evaluation expected in formal research papers. These papers will be curated by the papers co-chairs and will be presented in the conference along with the traditional research papers.

We are looking for papers that present ideas and applications of rendering (both high-end and real-time), as well as other aspects of image synthesis (e.g., image-based rendering, rendering for AR/VR, machine learning for rendering, etc.). Topics for possible Industry Track papers could include, but are not limited to:

- Novel rendering ideas that are interesting but might not be developed to the point of a formal research paper but are already successfully used in practice
- Extensions or twists on existing rendering algorithms that have been found to produce better results
- A description of a state-of-the-art rendering pipeline or rendering software system
- The publication of a new dataset that would facilitate research in rendering
- Position papers that pose interesting problems found in industry rendering applications that should be more emphasized in academic research

Papers accepted in this Industry Track will be published in the Eurographics Digital Library for archival purposes and presented at EGSR 2021, which will take place virtually and/or in-person from June 29th to July 2nd, 2021, hosted by Saarland University. Note that all papers will be presented virtually. An in-person event might happen, but attendance by authors won’t be mandatory.

### How to Submit Your Work

Please email the program chairs at chairs-egsr2021@eg.org with a PDF of your paper submission with the subject “Industry Track Submission” by the deadline below. The chairs will then curate the industry track program from the submitted papers and provide feedback to the authors. We expect that most papers will be fairly short (around 1-4 pages) although authors can submit longer ones if necessary to describe their idea. The authors should use the “Industry Track” template available following [this link](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/SR_2021/GetConferenceFile?fileID=12115).

### Important dates (All times are midnight, 23:59 UTC)

- Industry Track papers deadline: May 21st
- Author notification: June 4th
- Final papers due: July 2nd
