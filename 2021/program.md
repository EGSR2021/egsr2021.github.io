Roland Fleming is an interdisciplinary researcher specializing in the visual perception of materials, illumination and 3D shape. He did his undergraduate degree in Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology at Oxford University, graduating with First Class Honours in 1999, and completed his PhD in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT in 2004. He then served as a project leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in TÃ¼bingen. In 2010 he joined Giessen University as a junior professor. Since 2016, has been the Kurt Koffka Professor of Experimental Psychology.

His research combines psychophysics, neural modelling, computer graphics and image analysis to understand how the brain estimates the physical properties of objects. He has conducted a wide variety of studies on the perception of material properties such as glossiness, translucency, and viscosity and has applied insights from this work to the development of computer graphics algorithms for simulating material appearances. Roland Fleming has served as joint Editor-In-Chief of ACM Transactions on Applied Perception, an interdisciplinary journal dedicated to using perception to advance computer graphics and other fields. In 2012 he was awarded the Faculty Research Prize from the University of Giessen and in 2013 he was awarded the Young Investigator Award by the Vision Sciences Society. In 2016 was awarded an ERC Consolidator Award for the project "SHAPE: On the perception of growth, form and process".
