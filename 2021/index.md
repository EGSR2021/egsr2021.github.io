## Eurographics Symposium on Rendering

The 32nd edition of the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering will be held from June 29th to July 2nd, 2021.
We plan a 4 day event that will be compatible with fully remote participation, but hope to have at least some days of physical attendance if conditions are favorable at that time.
